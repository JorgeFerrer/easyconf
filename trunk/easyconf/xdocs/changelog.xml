    <section name="Changes in latest stable version (0.7.1)">
      <p>
         This is the first version which incorporates additions and changes based on
         feedback from the users. The most relevant changes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><p><b>Convention changes</b>:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>New format to represent property selectors. Now instead of
                  <tt>property:selector1.selector2</tt> you should write
                  <tt>property[selector1][selector2]</tt>. The old convention
                  was considered confusing for some users and didn't make so clear
                  that selectors are optional. For more information 
		            check the section on <a href="user/properties/filters.html">filters</a> 
                  of the user manual.
             	</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Improved support for system properties. Now system properties can
            have the name of the component which contain the property as a prefix 
            if its intent is to override its value. If the prefix is not used
            the system property will only be considered if the name is not
            the same as one of an existing property. For more information 
            check the section on <a href="user/properties/sysproperties.html">system
               properties</a> of the user manual.</li>
         <li>A new taglib to access the configuration object from JSPs. For more information 
            check the section on <a href="user/J2EE/taglibs.html">J2EE taglibs</a> 
            of the user manual.</li>
         <li>Included the taglib tld in <tt>easyconf.jar</tt> (inside the <tt>tld</tt> directory). Now
            this tld is generated using xdoclet</li>
         <li>Conversion of the properties of a component configuration to a <tt>DynaBean</tt>
            object</li>
         <li>Much more documentation</li>
         <li><p>Bug fixes:
            <ul>
               <li>The base properties file was mandatory if when reading the
						configuration object</li>
					<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1152885&amp;group_id=131552&amp;atid=721404">BUG

            </ul></p>
