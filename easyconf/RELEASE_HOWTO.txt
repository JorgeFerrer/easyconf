HOW TO MAKE AN EASYCONF RELEASE
-------------------------------

0) Prepare the documentation

All of EasyConf features must be apropriately documented in the 
the files at the xdocs directory. This content will be part of
EasyConf's website.


1) Execute maven release targets to create the release artifacts

This targets will ask you for things:
- Your CVS password (probably several times)
- Version number
- CVS tag name: follow the conventions of existing tags. Examples are:
	RELEASE_0_9
	RELEASE_0_9_5

The commands to execute are:

maven scm:prepare-release
maven -Dmaven.site.deploy.live=false -Dmaven.scm.bootstrap.goals=dist scm:perform-release 

NOTE: Sometimes passing the JMX test fails when using the scm:perform-release 
and the release process is aborted. In such a case go to the directory target/checkouts/easyconf/
and exec 'maven dist' manually to obtain the release artifacts and follow
with step 2.

2) Create a new release at SourceForge and upload the files
2.1) Go to EasyConf>admin>File releases (http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=131552)
2.2) Click [Add release] (http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/newrelease.php?package_id=144291&group_id=131552)
2.3) Set the version number and click OK
2.4) Write some change logs
2.5) Upload all the files found in target/checkouts/easyconf/target/distributions 
     to  ftp://anonymous@upload.sourceforge.net/incoming
2.6) Reload the sourceforge release files web page and select the uploaded files
2.7) Set the processor (platform-independent) and file type to each of the files
2.8) Send email notice

3) Add a news item at sourceforge about the new release

4) Upload to ibiblio's maven repository 
(More info about this step at: http://maven.apache.org/reference/repository-upload.html)

4.1) maven create-upload-bundle
4.2) Upload to Sourceforge. Example:
scp target/easyconf-0.9.5-bundle.jar jferrergerminus@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/e/ea/easyconf/htdocs/

4.3) Create a request in JIRA: http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10367&issuetype=3
For examples take a look at previous requests: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAVENUPLOAD-419
