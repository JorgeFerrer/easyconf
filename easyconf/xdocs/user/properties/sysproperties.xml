            EasyConf integrates the system properties to unify the sources of 
            configuration. This feature can be used to override the value of
            a property existent in a properties file or to define a new
            property.
         </p>
         <p>
            When used to overwrite a value of an existent property, the property
            name must be prefixed by the name of the component. For example, if
            you have in <tt>my-component.properties</tt>:
         </p>
         <source>
            db.type=default
         </source>
         <p>
            You can overwrite this value executing the application with the
            following command line arguments:
         </p>
         <source>
java -Dmy-component:db.type=oracle MyApp
			</source>
         <p>
            System properties are also available to be used as variables in
            the properties files. For example:
         </p>
         <source>
users.database.type=${db.type}
         </source>
         <p>
            Specifying system properties that will act as new properties is 
            useful, for example, when including files. Using this feature
            you can allow the user to choose the name of the file that
            will contain properties with overridden values (Rememenber that
            if the file does not exist it will be silently ignored).
            For example, if you execute the application with:
         </p>
         <source>
java -Dexternal-file=my-external-file.properties
			</source>
         <p>
            You can include an external file in <tt>my-component.properties</tt> with:
         </p>
         <source>
include-and-override=${external-file}
         </source>

            environemnts</a>
