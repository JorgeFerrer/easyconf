      <p>
        Every property or xml file looked for by EasyConf is searched in several places
        to allow the maximum flexibility. The order in which this places are checked is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>URL: checks if the specified file name is a valid URL and if it is tries to get it.</li>
        <li>File system: if it is an absolute path (starts with a slash) it is interpreted from the
        root of the file system. Otherwise the directory where the JVM is being executed will
        be used as the base directory.</li>
        <li>User home directory: the home directory obtained with the <tt>user.home</tt> system property
        will be used as the base directory</li>
        <li>Context classpath</li>
        <li>System claspath</li>
       </ol>
       <p>
         This behaviour is implemented by Jakarta's commons configuration. You can check the locate method of the
         <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration/xref/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationUtils.html">ConfigurationUtils</a>
         class for more information.
