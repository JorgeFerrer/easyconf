         <p>
            After its release under an open source license the main purpose of
            its developers is to receive feedback on its conventions. Once
            those conventions are consolidated version 1.0 will be released
         </p>
         <p>
            In the meanwhile we have several features in mind. We expect most
            of them to be finished in the first half of 2005.

            <b>Planned features for property files</b>
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Reloading (done in version 0.9.0)</li>
            <li>Properties in database (beta implementation in version 0.9.0)</li>

          </ul>   
         <p>
            <b>Planned features for XML files</b>
         </p>
         <p>The first planned features are to solve the currently known
            limitations of the support of XML files with respecto to
            the configuration through property files. These are:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>You can only have one XML file per component</li>
            <li>There is no complete support for changing XML configuration
            when aggregating components. Only that offered by variables</li>
            <li>There is no complete support for changing XML configuration
            for each differnt environment. Only that offered by variables.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Other planned features for XML files are:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Storage of XML files in a database</li>
            <li>Reloading (done in version 0.9.0)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
           <b>Finish the reload configuration service</b>
         </p>
         <p>
            Implement the servlet interface and fix it by including
            Jakarta Commons Configuration v1.1 when it is released.
